Description: Provides solutions to the knapsack problem using dynamic programming, brute force, and greedy heuristic approaches. The package includes functions to calculate the maximum value that can be carried in a knapsack given the weight limit and the value/weight of the items. It also allows for performance profiling of the implemented algorithms.
